When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working not from my own computer or when I'm making changes to someone's repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I have more control over the changes in the code, I commit them when I'm sure that everything 
works fine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking allows to copy someone's repository without cloning it to my local machine first.
When I want to make changes to the code I need to pull it to my machine. Forking is cloning
that github makes for me on their machines. Github makes track of the number of people
who made fork. It suggests changes back to the original repository.

I can clone a git repository to my machine.

I use branches when I'm working with one repository and want to add some changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When I know I will be working without the internet access, so I can know what changed 
when I have the internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would have to get or give the copies of all files, keep track of all the changes, constantly checking
if anyone made a change and update my file or tell others to update their files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

I would want to make changes while working alone on my own project because I know what
changes I did or want to do. I would use a separate branch to make changes while working
on a big project with other people.
