When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working not from my own computer or when I'm making changes to someone's repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I have more control over the changes in the code, I commit them when I'm sure that everything 
works fine.
